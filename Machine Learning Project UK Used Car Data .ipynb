    "The goal of our project is to make a price prediction system for used cars and to extract interesting information and insights. The price prediction model and insights can be extracted from a dataset of different used cars. The model and insights could be then later used as a tool for a second-hand car retailer to give insights to potential customers shopping for a second-hand car. Moreover, this price prediction model and insights tool may also come in handy for a customer looking to sell his/her car.\n",
